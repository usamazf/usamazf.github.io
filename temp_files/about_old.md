### About me
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in *Scientific Computing* at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), where I am supervised by Associate Professor [Salman Toor](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N7-398). Before this, I earned a Master‚Äôs degree in *Advanced Computing Science* from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Beijing, China and a Bachelor's degree in *Software Engineering* from [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan.


### Research Interests
My research lies at the intersection of distributed optimization, distributed machine learning, and federated learning, with a particular focus on adversarial robustness, and the security and privacy challenges inherent in decentralized systems.
