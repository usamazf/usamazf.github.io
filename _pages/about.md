### About me
I am a Ph.D. student in Scientific Computing at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), where I am supervised by Associate Professor [Salman Toor](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N7-398). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Advanced Computing Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Beijing, China and a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan.


### Research Interests
I am interested in distributed optimization, distributed machine learning, and federated machine learning. In particular, my research focuses on adversarial networks, and security and privacy issues in federated machine learning.
